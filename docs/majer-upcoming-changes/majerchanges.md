# removal of the webviewtag

we have done research related to webview, its stability, security implacations and more, it is still very decent to use in terms of
a baseline, chromum has deprecated there chromeapps program a little white ago, last couple of threads i see where 3 to 4 years ago.
meanwhile even tho the api for webview is deprecated, the reasoning for this is because it is undergoing some insane ammounf of changes, we do not know if its being replaced or completly removed as electron and chromium have not been very direct about the whole situation yet

"Do not fear" we are in the process of finding a better solution than webview, for now, this project uses the webviewtag as a placeholder.
